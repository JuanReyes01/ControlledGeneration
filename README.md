# K-means Used to Find Direction Vectors in the Latent Space

## Overview
- [StyleGAN2-ADA](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file) was used as a starting point to create two image generation models.
- K-means is used as an unsupervised method to obtain latent space direction vectors for controlled generation.

- It is possible to search for 'good' direction vectors by examining the density of the clusters.

- All vectors can be analyzed individually.

## Requirements (From [StyleGAN2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch?tab=readme-ov-file))
- Linux and Windows are supported, but we recommend Linux for performance and compatibility reasons.
- 1â€“8 high-end NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB of memory. We have done all testing and development using NVIDIA DGX-1 with 8 Tesla V100 GPUs.
- 64-bit Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.7.1. See [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) for install instructions.
- CUDA toolkit 11.0 or later. Use at least version 11.1 if running on RTX 3090. (Why is a separate CUDA toolkit installation required? See comments in [issue #2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/issues/2).)
- Python libraries: `pip install click requests tqdm pyspng ninja imageio-ffmpeg==0.4.3`. We use the Anaconda3 2020.11 distribution, which installs most of these by default.

The code relies heavily on custom PyTorch extensions that are compiled on the fly using NVCC. On Windows, the compilation requires Microsoft Visual Studio. We recommend installing Visual Studio Community Edition and adding it to `PATH` using `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<VERSION>\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"`.
